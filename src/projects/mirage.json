  "about": "I have an alienating feeling when I think of it. It’s something I control, something I depend on.\nOn rare occasions, like ones filled with pain or pleasure, it becomes an integral part of me. I ’m constantly torn between trying to get intense feelings from it and trying to take good care of it. Fear that it will fail me is always there and as time goes by it grows stronger. \nSome nights I would just wake up, stare into nothing and worry. I would relentlessly go over and over how I feel at the moment. More often then not I would feel suboptimal and I would iterate through all the possible reasons for that.\nAt times I would become desperate and, in a delirium-like state, I would plead for a better vessel than this meaty thing.\nIn play with others things don’t look so tragic. Seeing them handling their fragility helps me as if I ‘m looking into some corrective mirror. I guess it has to do with being less emotionally attached to thoughts of ill-fated outcome and with that more able to think rationally.\nWhether I ‘m upset or calm I wish my body to last.",
